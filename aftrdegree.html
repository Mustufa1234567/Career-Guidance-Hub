                 Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.
            Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).
            Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.
            Data science is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. 
			It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.
			However, data science is different from computer science and information science. <br><br>
